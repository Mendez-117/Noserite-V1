                Noserite is a webpage developed by Aryan Khairnar. Moving your 
                nose allows you to write or draw on the canvas. This was 
                originally made by him in grade 6, to win an Inter-House competition.
                He came second. But, this webpage has a practical use as well. Disabled
                people may use this to communicate and engage in conversation with 
                others. This is the main goal of the webpage to help people, who
                cannot speak, communicate. So that at the end of the day, their loved ones
                can tell them... "You can communicate!"
